                    I’m a product designer with a passion for creating pleasurable interfaces that enhance user satisfaction with the product through usability and accessibility. The process of discovering, researching real pain points and, designing a solution to the problem is innate for me. I’m energized by problem complexities. Over the years I've had the opportunity to work in different industries and I believe that through my diverse experience I have developed the skills to understand what the user's needs are. As an effective communicator and an empathetic problem solver, I am passionate about speaking the user’s language and creating solutions that address the user’s pain points.

                    How did I get here?
                    I would call myself a “Henna designer turned UX designer”. As a child, I was gifted with the art of sketching and henna designing. I used to doodle and re-create any drawing that I liked. As I grew up, I started a small henna company where I design custom henna pieces for my clients. I have meeting sessions with my clients to discover and understand their needs. During this time, I wanted to formulate my business to the next level and wanted my art form to live in a different medium. While I was looking around, I stumbled upon Dribbble and I was blown away by the sheer amount of talent of design on this platform and what really impressed me the most was product design.

                    My professional life?

                    I’m currently working as an immigration coordinator for Microsoft. In my daily role, I assist Microsoft employees in obtaining work permits and business visas to facilitate smooth travel for projects around the world.

                    With the high complexities in the current immigration system, I found out that there is an extensive need for a product that could simplify this process. To fix this problem, I established process flows and build documents that could easily be followed by the employees. The process of understanding the key problem and building a solution links closely to the design process and through my artistic skills, I wish to build super fun and interactive platforms.

                    Other than Design?

                    I like apple products. Beautiful animations. Delicious food. Holiday in Dubai. Game of Thrones. Instagram and many other things.
